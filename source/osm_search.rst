#. In the search box, enter the name of the object of interest, for example, "West Oxfordshire" and click on the "GO" button. The search results will be displayed under the search bar; if there is a complete match, the type of object (in our case, "City Border") and its full name will be indicated. The "More results" button will display other similarly named objects.
